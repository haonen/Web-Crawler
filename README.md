# Web-Crawler Notes
novice

Hi Humans! I am Yuwei Zhang, an incoming student of the University of Chicago. I am going to attend the Master Program of Computational Anaysis and Public Policy. I learnt Web Crawler in R during my internship at the Rising Lab of China Business News Weekly. The contents of this project were written by Google docs before and now I put it here for the convenience of disscusion and the beauty of typography. It was written in Chinese and I might translate it into English someday 0w0.

#背景知识

|数据交换语言|XML
|-----------|：--------：|
            |JSON
|访问方式|GET|RCurl-GET
             |httr-GET
             |base-GET
             |rvest-GET
        |POST|RCurl-POST

以上是写爬虫需要了解的基本知识，数据交换语言可以理解为是目标网页存储数据的方式，访问方式有两种，目前我学到的是get有四种命令可以使用，post有一种。不同的存储方式和访问方式都会影响到你要调用的命令。

对上面这个简单的表格有个印象之后，会有助于下面的观察步骤。
